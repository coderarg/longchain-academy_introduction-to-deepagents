# python/m6/dvd_rental_analyst/channels/slack.py
"""Lets people @mention the agent in Slack.

`channels.slack()` takes MDA runtime options only, no name or description. The
defaults are what you want for a first deploy, so the bare call is enough.

With this file present, `mda deploy` prints an authorization link near the end.
Approving it lets LangSmith create the Slack app, install it, and point its
Events endpoint at the deployment. The bot token is stored as a workspace
connection (`mda connections list`), so it stays out of .env.

Press Enter at that prompt to skip it; the deploy finishes with Slack events
disabled and you can authorize on a later deploy.
